  What Should We Do Next?

  I recommend we proceed in this order:

  Option 1: Get It Running Locally (30-45 minutes) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

  Let me help you:
  1. Setup PostgreSQL
  2. Create .env files
  3. Initialize database
  4. Install frontend dependencies
  5. Start both servers
  6. Test with your OERA data

  Option 2: Add Missing Features First (2-3 hours)

  I can build:
  - PDF report generation
  - Excel export functionality
  - CSV template download

  Option 3: Deploy to Production (2-4 hours)

  I can create:
  - Docker deployment (one command)
  - Cloud deployment scripts (AWS/Heroku/DigitalOcean)
  - Production configuration

  Option 4: Do Everything (6-10 hours)

  Complete end-to-end MVP delivery

  My Recommendation: Start with Option 1

  Let's get it running locally so you can see it work with your actual 2025 OERA data, then decide what features to add. This way you can:
  - Verify calculations match your Excel
  - Test the user experience
  - Identify any issues early
  - Make informed decisions about features

  Shall I help you with the local setup? I can guide you step-by-step or write an automated setup script for you. 🚀
